_Things to be done_

1. **Linting**:
   - [x] Use a linter like ESLint to ensure consistent code style and catch potential errors.
   - [x] Code Formatting: Use a code formatter like Prettier to maintain consistent code formatting across your codebase.
   - [x] Modular Code: Structure your code into modular components and services to enhance readability and maintainability.
   - [ ] TypeScript: Consider using TypeScript for better type safety and catching errors during development.
2. **Testing**
   - [ ] Unit Testing: Write unit tests for individual functions and components using a framework like Jest or Mocha.
   - [ ] Integration Testing: Test how different parts of your application work together.
   - [ ] End-to-End Testing: Use a tool like Cypress or Selenium to test the entire flow of your application from a user's perspective.
   - [ ] Test Coverage: Ensure a high level of test coverage to catch potential issues early.
3. **Error Handling**
   - [x] Global Error Handler: Implement a robust global error handling mechanism to catch and handle errors gracefully.
   - [x] User-Friendly Error Messages: Show user-friendly error messages instead of technical jargon.
   - [ ] Logging: Implement logging to track errors and important events using tools like Winston or Morgan.
4. **Security**
   - [x] Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
   - [ ] Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
   - [ ] HTTPS: Ensure your app runs over HTTPS to secure data transmission.
5. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Database Indexing: Optimize database queries and use indexing to improve performance.
   - [ ] Caching: Implement caching strategies to reduce load times (e.g., using Redis).
   - [ ] Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for components and assets to improve initial load times.
6. **User Experience (UX)**
   - [ ] Responsive Design: Ensure your app is fully responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
   - [ ] Intuitive UI/UX: Focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - [ ] Accessibility: Ensure your app is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., using ARIA roles and keyboard navigation).
7. **Documentation**
   - [ ] API Documentation: Document your APIs using tools like Swagger UI and YAML to create interactive API documentation.
   - [ ] Code Documentation: Add JSDoc or TypeDoc comments to your code to help other developers understand it.
   - [ ] README: Maintain a comprehensive README file that e+xplains how to set up, run, and contribute to your project.
8. **Deployment**
   - [ ] CI/CD: Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins.
   - [ ] Containerization: Use Docker to containerize your application for consistent deployment across different environments.
   - [ ] Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerting for your application using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic.
9. **Version Control**
   - [ ] Git: Use Git for version control and maintain a clear commit history.
   - [ ] Branching Strategy: Follow a branching strategy like GitFlow to manage feature development and releases.
10. **Third-Party Integrations**

    - [ ] Payment Gateway: Integrate a payment gateway if your app requires payment processing.
    - [ ] Social Media Authentication: Provide social media authentication options for easier user login.

## Code Quality Tools:

- [ ] Add end-to-end tests with Cypress.

# Error Handling:

- [x] Improve error messages.
- [ ] Set up logging with Winston.

# Security Enhancements:

- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication.
- [ ] Add input validation with Joi.

# User Experience:

- [ ] Improve the UI with a framework like Material-UI or Bootstrap.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design using CSS media queries or a framework like Tailwind CSS.
